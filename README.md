Android Sunflower
=================

A gardening app illustrating Android development with my best practices.

Introduction
------------

Android Jetpack is a set of components, tools and guidance to make great Android apps. They bring
together the existing Support Library and Architecture Components and arrange them into four
categories:

### Unsplash API key

Sunflower uses the [Unsplash API](https://unsplash.com/developers) to load pictures on the gallery
screen. To use the API, you will need to obtain a free developer API key. See the
[Unsplash API Documentation](https://unsplash.com/documentation) for instructions.

Once you have the key, add this line to the `gradle.properties` file, either in your user home
directory (usually `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` on Linux and Mac) or in the project's root folder:

```
unsplash_access_key=<your Unsplash access key>
```

The app is still usable without an API key, though you won't be able to navigate to the gallery screen.
